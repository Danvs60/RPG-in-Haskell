Simple RPG game developed in Haskell.
# The game
The game is really simple. It involves a player, items , monsters and rooms.
The player can move in certain directions to discover new rooms, with new monsters
and new items to find.
The end goal is reaching the treasure room.
# My thoughts
It was really fun to try and develop a game with a functional approach.
Normally I would do this in an OOP manner, but this made me practice and 
understand the functional programming paradigm better.
